# Filming the Help Video

Filming the help video requires a little bit of careful juggling so that my personal information isn't visible on screen. For this, a *Developer > Filming Mode* has been created. In filming mode, several parts of the normal Bing Maps screen are hidden by replacement images. However, you can still click through. 

A key ability is that you need to click the status ("Be sure to log in to see your collections") and press letter keys A S or D just a fraction of a second before you click on the screen.


## Exact steps 

1. Run the program
2. Move the map to some random location
3. Select Developer > Filming Mode
4. Click on the status bar
