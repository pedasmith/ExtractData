# Technical details on supports file formats

The app exports in two formats: CSV (compatible with OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps) and GeoJSON. Because of the limited number of mapping sites, testing has been limited.

## OpenStreetMaps / UMap

The UMAP project lets ordinary users (and there's nobody more ordinary than me!) create a map

Prerequisites: export data in "Google" CSV format.

Steps:
1. Open [UMAP](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/). The map is in French
2. Click "Create a map"
3. On the right side, click the ⮉ up arrow (Import data) or press CTRL+i
4. Click "Choose files" and select the file you've created.




## Google Maps

Google maps says they support: CSV, TSV, KML, KMZ, GPX, XLSX and some Google-specific format from Google Sheets and phots.

Prerequisites: you must have a Google account. 

Steps:
1. Go to [google.com/maps](https://www.google.com/maps)
2. Saved > Maps > Open My Maps. You might also be able to link directly to [Google my maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d)
3. Create new map
4. In the layers, click "Import"
5. Drag the CSV into the box and answer the questions about imports

### Known issues

I can't find any information on how to create a CSV file that doesn't pop up the question box. Ideally, the CSV would have the right

## Geojson.io

Works like a champ. Imports from the File > Export GeoJSON menu item. Can read the name and notes, albeit clumsily.

	
## Utter failures

### ⛔ Here.com! OMG, they did the maps for Windows Phone!

Blast from my past, when I had a Windows phone (over the years, I had three!). It's clumsy and slow, but you can import a GeoJSON file as generated by the File > Export GeoJSON menu item. However, the actual data (name of places and notes) are not shown.

### ⛔ https://mapscaping.com/display-csv-data-on-google-maps/

Tried several times to upload a CSV file; failed every time even when I simplified the file to almost nothing. There was no indication ever that the file was being processed, and no error message.

### ⛔ Mapquest doesn't support importing places

You can enter places in individually, but you can't just import them. And a giant **fail to mapquest** for making deleting an account so hard.

### ⛔ Waze is useless for tracking places

AFAICT, Waze doesn't support general mapping; it's strictly for traffic.
